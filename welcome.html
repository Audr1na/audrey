<h1>Meet Audrey Schmook</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Audrey Schmook, and I made this personal website as homework for my <a href="http://okcoders.com/apply/">Coding Bootcamp</a> through OK Coders. Yup, that's right - I wrote the code for this website! I don't know about you, but I'm pretty impressed.
</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking, "This looks like a website made in the '90s." Well, you're right. I'm sure that when I learn CSS, this will look a lot better!</p>
